Credit Risk Modelling Using ML Techniques
– Developed a predictive model to categorize applicants into credit approval tiers based on their risk profile.
– Performed feature selection with Chi-Square, ANOVA, and VIF to reduce 80+ features to the 42 most impactful features.
– Applied Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost model; fine-tuned model hyperparameters using CV.
– Selected the XGBoost model, achieving 80% precision and 73% recall.
– Tracked experiments with MLflow and served the model for inference using a FastAPI endpoint.
